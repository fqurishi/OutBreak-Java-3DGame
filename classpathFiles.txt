The zip file "javagaming" contains everything needed to install the "javagaming" library.
In addition to this ReadMe file, it contains the following:


TO INSTALL THE JAVAGAMING LIBRARY:

Only works for Java 8

Before trying to install the "javagaming" libraries, you'll need to MAKE SURE
that you have properly and completely installed a JAVA JDK on your machine.
"JDK" means "development kit".  Open a command window and type:  java -version
If your version is only a JRE, then you'll need to install a JDK before proceeding.

Uncompress either javagaming.zip depending on your version
of Java.  Regardless of which one you uncompress, after uncompressing there is a
folder inside named "javagaming".  That is the folder that you will use.

1) Place the "javagaming" folder in the location where you wish to install the
   library.  These instructions assume you have placed it at the root of "C:".
   The path files described below also assume this - i.e., that you have created a
   folder called "C:\javagaming".
